================================\r
\r
You've unlocked the secrets file! Here's what you've discovered:\r
\r
🎮 EASTER EGG ACHIEVEMENTS:\r
[ ✓ ] Konami Code Master - You found the terminal!\r
[ ? ] File Explorer - Read all files (hint: try 'ls' and 'cat')\r
[ ? ] Command Master - Use 10 different commands\r
[ ? ] Matrix Dweller - Enter the matrix (hint: try 'matrix')\r
[ ? ] Time Traveler - Check the 'date' multiple times\r
[ ? ] Coffee Connoisseur - Read about coffee consumption\r
\r
🕵️ HIDDEN COMMANDS:\r
Try these if you haven't already:\r
→ whoami       (discover your identity)\r
→ matrix       (take the red pill)\r
→ joke         (need a laugh?)\r
→ coffee       (see my coffee stats)\r
→ skills       (ASCII art skills)\r
→ quote        (random AI quote)\r
\r
💎 FINAL SECRET:\r
The real easter egg was the commands we ran along the way.\r

║            THE AI ENGINEER'S MANIFESTO             ║\r
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝\r
\r
1. Build with Purpose\r
   AI is a tool, not magic. Every model serves a purpose.\r
   If you can't explain why you're using it, don't.\r
\r
2. Data is Everything\r
   A great model with bad data is useless.\r
   A good model with great data is powerful.\r
\r
3. Simple > Complex\r
   Don't use Transformers when Logistic Regression works.\r
   Complexity should be earned, not assumed.\r
\r
4. Deploy or Die\r
   Research is important, but production is real.\r
   A model that works on your laptop means nothing.\r
\r
5. Ethics First\r
   Every AI decision affects real people.\r
   If you wouldn't want it used on you, don't build it.\r
\r
6. Never Stop Learning\r
   AI moves fast. Yesterday's SOTA is today's baseline.\r
   Read papers, experiment, fail, learn, repeat.\r
\r
7. Community Over Competition\r
   Open source, share knowledge, help others.\r
   We're building the future together.\r
\r
8. Measure What Matters\r
   Accuracy is one metric. Fairness, speed, cost matter too.\r
   Optimize for impact, not just numbers.\r
\r
9. Question Everything\r
   "It works" is not enough. Understand WHY it works.\r
   Intuition comes from deep understanding.\r
\r
10. Have Fun\r
    If you're not excited about what you're building,\r
    why are you building it? Passion shows in the work.\r

  'coffee.log': `☕ COFFEE CONSUMPTION LOG ☕\r
============================\r
\r
TOTAL CUPS THIS WEEK: 42\r
AVERAGE PER DAY: 6 cups\r
PEAK HOUR: 2:00 AM (debugging session)\r
FAVORITE: Turkish Coffee (strong enough to debug itself)\r
\r
CORRELATION ANALYSIS:\r
→ Coffee ↑ → Code Quality ↑ (p < 0.001)\r
→ Coffee ↑ → Bugs Fixed ↑\r
→ Coffee ↑ → Sleep ↓ (unfortunately)\r
\r
RECENT ENTRIES:\r
[2025-12-16 02:30] Emergency coffee. Model not converging.\r
[2025-12-16 05:15] Victory coffee. Model converged!\r
[2025-12-16 09:00] Celebration coffee. Deployed to prod.\r
[2025-12-16 14:00] Regular coffee. Just because.\r
[2025-12-16 18:30] Existential coffee. Why am I here?\r
[2025-12-16 23:00] Midnight coffee. Easter eggs won't code themselves.\r
\r
CONCLUSION: Coffee is to engineers what gradient descent is to neural nets.\r
Both essential for finding the optimal solution.`,

  'bugs.txt': `🐛 BUG TRACKER (aka "Feature Log")\r
====================================\r
\r
CRITICAL "FEATURES":\r
1. ✓ AI Assistant gives answers in Shakespearean English\r
   - Status: "It's not a bug, it's artistic"\r
   - Fix: Set temperature to 0.7 instead of 2.0\r
\r
2. ✓ 3D Neural Network rotates too enthusiastically\r
   - Status: "It's just excited to meet you"\r
   - Fix: Reduced rotation speed by 50%\r
\r
3. ✓ Terminal accepts Klingon commands\r
   - Status: "Qapla'! That's intentional."\r
   - Fix: Feature, not bug\r
\r
MINOR QUIRKS:\r
→ Command palette searches coffee when stressed\r
→ Footer links occasionally lead to motivational quotes\r
→ Konami code plays secret sound (shh, it's a feature)\r
→ 3D particles form "HIRE ME" at random (subtle, right?)\r
\r
PHILOSOPHICAL BUGS:\r
→ Code exists in superposition until observed\r
→ Schrödinger's semicolon: both there and not there\r
→ Heisenbug: Disappears when you try to debug it\r
\r
WONTFIX:\r
→ Easter egg terminal is too addictive\r
→ Portfolio makes recruiters say "wow"\r
→ User keeps exploring instead of leaving\r
\r
Remember: Every bug is just an undocumented feature waiting\r
to be discovered. - Anonymous Developer`,

  '.secrets': `🎊 CONGRATULATIONS! 🎊\r
\r
You found the hidden file!\r
\r
This is the kind of curiosity that makes a great engineer.\r
Not everything is documented. Sometimes you need to explore,\r
experiment, and discover things on your own.\r
\r
✨ SUPER SECRET MESSAGE ✨\r
The real treasure isn't the easter eggs you find,\r
but the journey of discovery along the way.\r
\r
Also, there's one more secret:\r
Try typing 'quote' five times in a row... 👀\r
\r
Keep exploring. Keep building. Keep learning.\r
