        "bio": "I'm a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at İnönü University. Since 2022, I've been focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning, developing various projects with technologies like Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn. I've gained experience across a wide range of areas, from image processing to natural language processing, from reinforcement learning to deep learning. In every project, I make it a principle to translate theory into practice, solve complex problems with analytical thinking, and continuously learn. My goal is to specialize in AI/ML after graduation and become an engineer who applies data science and AI technologies to real-world problems. I value contributing to open-source projects, writing technical blog posts, and sharing knowledge.",
